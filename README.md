# react-avatars

Small basic React project that takes a selfie, requests an API and renders an avatar.

## How to run

-   Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/sergiovp/react-avatars.git`
-   Install dependencies `npm i`
-   Run the project `npm start`

You must create a file called .env in the root directory (a ![template file](https://github.com/sergiovp/react-avatars/blob/main/.env.template) is provided in the repository). __In this file you must specify a valid token for consuming the API__.

### User guide
